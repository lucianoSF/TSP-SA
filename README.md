Simulated Annealing implementation for Traveling Salesman Problem 

This repository contains the implementation for both, a Simulated Anneling metaheur√≠stic and the optimal approach to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem.

The instances used in this work, are adaptations of the instances found in this:
